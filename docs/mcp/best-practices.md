# Best Practices Guide

This guide provides expert recommendations for getting the most out of the QEC-SFT Platform, writing effective governance requirements, and implementing generated policies successfully.

## üìù Writing Effective LSUs (Logical Semantic Units)

### Core Principles

#### 1. Be Specific and Measurable
**Good Examples:**
```
‚úÖ "User passwords must contain at least 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters"
‚úÖ "Database backups must be performed daily at 2:00 AM UTC and stored for 90 days"
‚úÖ "API rate limits must not exceed 1000 requests per hour per authenticated user"
```

**Poor Examples:**
```
‚ùå "Passwords should be strong"
‚ùå "Data should be backed up regularly"
‚ùå "API usage should be reasonable"
```

#### 2. Use Active Voice and Clear Language
**Good Examples:**
```
‚úÖ "The system must validate user credentials before granting access"
‚úÖ "Audit logs must record all administrative actions with timestamps"
‚úÖ "Financial transactions over $10,000 require dual approval"
```

**Poor Examples:**
```
‚ùå "User credentials should be validated by the system when access is granted"
‚ùå "Administrative actions might be logged if auditing is enabled"
‚ùå "Large financial transactions may need extra approval"
```

#### 3. Include Complete Context
**Good Examples:**
```
‚úÖ "Customer service representatives can access customer data only during active support tickets assigned to them"
‚úÖ "Production database deployments must be approved by the DBA team and scheduled during maintenance windows"
‚úÖ "PII data must be encrypted using AES-256 both at rest and in transit, with key rotation every 90 days"
```

### LSU Structure Templates

#### Security Requirements
```
Template: "[Who] must [action] [what] [when/how] to [ensure/prevent] [outcome]"

Examples:
- "All users must authenticate using multi-factor authentication when accessing production systems to prevent unauthorized access"
- "Application logs must exclude sensitive data such as passwords, SSNs, and credit card numbers to prevent information disclosure"
```

#### Compliance Requirements
```
Template: "[System/Process] must [comply with] [standard/regulation] by [implementing] [specific controls]"

Examples:
- "Data processing systems must comply with GDPR by implementing consent management, data portability, and deletion capabilities"
- "Financial reporting must comply with SOX requirements by maintaining audit trails and segregation of duties"
```

#### Business Process Requirements
```
Template: "[Business process] must [action] [criteria] [timeframe] with [approval/validation] from [authority]"

Examples:
- "Expense reports over $500 must be reviewed and approved by direct managers within 5 business days"
- "Code changes to production must be peer-reviewed and approved by senior developers before deployment"
```

#### Data Governance Requirements
```
Template: "[Data type] must be [protected/managed] through [method] with [access controls] and [retention period]"

Examples:
- "Customer payment data must be tokenized using industry-standard methods with access limited to authorized payment processors and retained for 7 years"
- "Employee performance data must be accessible only to HR personnel and direct managers with annual review and 3-year retention"
```

## üéØ Optimization Strategies

### For Better AI Analysis

#### 1. Provide Sufficient Context
```
Instead of: "Users need permission"
Write: "Users must obtain written permission from their manager before accessing confidential project documents"

Why: AI models perform better with complete context about who, what, when, where, and why.
```

#### 2. Avoid Ambiguous Terms
```
Replace ambiguous terms:
‚ùå "soon" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "within 24 hours"
‚ùå "secure" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "encrypted using AES-256"
‚ùå "authorized" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "approved by the security team"
‚ùå "appropriate" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "meeting PCI DSS Level 1 requirements"
```

#### 3. Use Industry-Standard Terminology
```
‚úÖ Use: "HTTPS", "OAuth 2.0", "RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)"
‚úÖ Use: "GDPR", "HIPAA", "SOX compliance"
‚úÖ Use: "AES-256 encryption", "SHA-256 hashing"
```

### For Coherent Results

#### 1. Avoid Contradictory Requirements
```
‚ùå Contradictory:
"All user data must be immediately accessible for analysis AND all user data must be anonymized before any processing"

‚úÖ Clear:
"User data must be anonymized before analysis, with original data accessible only to authorized data stewards for legitimate business purposes"
```

#### 2. Specify Exception Handling
```
‚úÖ Complete requirement:
"All financial transactions must be processed within 2 business days, except for transactions over $100,000 which require additional compliance review and may take up to 5 business days"
```

#### 3. Define Success Criteria
```
‚úÖ Measurable success:
"Email notifications must be delivered within 5 minutes of trigger events, with delivery confirmation tracked and 99.9% delivery rate maintained"
```

## üîß Using Analysis Results Effectively

### Interpreting Coherence Scores

#### High Coherence (80-100%)
```
Meaning: Strong semantic consistency across all representations
Action: Proceed with confidence, consider implementation
Review: Focus on performance optimization and edge cases
```

#### Medium Coherence (60-79%)
```
Meaning: Generally consistent with some minor issues
Action: Review failed stabilizer checks and address specific concerns
Review: Pay attention to security and compliance findings
```

#### Low Coherence (Below 60%)
```
Meaning: Significant semantic issues detected
Action: Revise LSU based on detailed diagnostics
Review: Often indicates unclear or contradictory requirements
```
