# Getting Started with QEC-SFT Platform

Welcome to the QEC-SFT (Quantum-Inspired Semantic Fault Tolerance) Platform! This guide will help you get started with analyzing governance requirements and generating certified policies.

## üéØ What is QEC-SFT?

The QEC-SFT Platform is an AI-powered system that helps organizations:
- **Analyze governance requirements** for semantic consistency
- **Generate certified policies** in multiple formats (Rego, TLA+, Python tests)
- **Validate security implications** of policy implementations
- **Ensure compliance** with regulatory standards
- **Provide audit trails** with certificates of semantic integrity

## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Access the Platform
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to [https://qec-sft.example.com](https://qec-sft.example.com)
3. The platform loads instantly - no account registration required for demo mode!

### Step 2: Enter Your First Requirement
1. Look for the **"Logical Semantic Unit"** text area
2. Enter a governance requirement, for example:
   ```
   All financial transactions over $10,000 must be approved by two authorized managers before processing.
   ```
3. The system accepts requirements in plain English - no technical formatting needed!

### Step 3: Choose Your Analysis Mode
- **Simulation Mode** (Default): Fast analysis using built-in algorithms
- **AI-Enhanced Mode**: Advanced analysis powered by NVIDIA's AI models
  - Toggle the switch to enable AI-Enhanced Mode
  - This provides deeper semantic analysis and security assessment

### Step 4: Execute the Analysis
1. Click the **"Execute QEC-SFT Pipeline"** button
2. Watch the progress indicator - typical analysis takes 1-3 seconds
3. The system processes your requirement through multiple validation layers

### Step 5: Review Your Results
Once complete, you'll see:
- **Certification Status**: COHERENT (passed) or INCOHERENT (needs review)
- **Coherence Score**: Percentage indicating semantic consistency
- **Generated Artifacts**: Policy code, tests, and documentation
- **Risk Assessment**: Security and compliance evaluation

## üìã Understanding Your Results

### Certification Status
- ‚úÖ **COHERENT**: Your requirement passed all semantic checks and can be safely implemented
- ‚ùå **INCOHERENT**: Issues were detected that need attention before implementation

### Generated Artifacts
The system creates four key files:
1. **policy.rego**: Open Policy Agent policy code
2. **specification.tla**: Formal mathematical specification
3. **test_suite.py**: Comprehensive test cases
4. **documentation.md**: Implementation guide and explanations

### Semantic Syndrome Analysis
This shows the results of five critical checks:
- **Syntax Validation**: Code structure and format
- **Semantic Consistency**: Logical coherence across artifacts
- **Security Analysis**: Vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Check**: Efficiency considerations
- **Compliance Audit**: Regulatory alignment

## üí° Example Use Cases

### Financial Services
```
All customer data must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption both at rest and in transit, with keys rotated every 90 days.
```

### Healthcare
```
Patient medical records can only be accessed by authorized healthcare providers with a legitimate treatment relationship.
```

### Human Resources
```
Employee performance reviews must be conducted annually with input from direct supervisors and documented in the HR system.
```

### IT Security
```
All software deployments to production must undergo automated security scanning and manual code review approval.
```

## üéõÔ∏è Interface Overview

### Main Dashboard
- **LSU Input Area**: Where you enter your governance requirements
- **AI Toggle**: Switch between Simulation and AI-Enhanced modes
- **Control Buttons**: Execute, Clear, and Test AI Connection
- **Status Indicators**: Show AI service availability and analysis progress

### Results Panel

- **Syndrome Visualization**: Color-coded results for each validation check
- **Artifacts Display**: Generated code and documentation with download options
- **Certificate Package**: Complete JSON output for integration purposes

### Navigation Tabs
- **QEC Pipeline**: Main analysis interface
- **Algorand Dashboard**: Blockchain integration tools (advanced users)

## üîß Tips for Better Results

### Writing Effective Requirements
1. **Be Specific**: Include who, what, when, where, and how
2. **Use Active Voice**: "System must validate..." instead of "Validation should occur..."
3. **Include Constraints**: Specify limits, timeframes, and conditions
4. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Use precise terms rather than vague language

### Good Examples
‚úÖ "All API requests must include valid authentication tokens that expire after 1 hour"
‚úÖ "Database backups must be performed daily at 2 AM and stored for 30 days"
‚úÖ "User passwords must contain at least 12 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols"

### Examples to Improve
‚ùå "Security should be good" ‚Üí Too vague
‚ùå "Users might need to login sometimes" ‚Üí Unclear requirements
‚ùå "Data should be protected" ‚Üí Missing specifics

## üõ°Ô∏è AI-Enhanced Mode Benefits

When AI-Enhanced Mode is available, you get:
- **Deeper Analysis**: Advanced semantic understanding using large language models
- **Security Insights**: AI-powered vulnerability detection
- **Better Diagnostics**: Detailed explanations when issues are found
- **Enhanced Artifacts**: More sophisticated generated code and documentation

### Checking AI Availability
- Look for the status indicator: "NVIDIA Llama-3.1 Nemotron Ultra Ready" (green)
- If unavailable, you'll see "AI Service Unavailable (Fallback Mode)" (red)
- Use the "Test AI Connection" button to verify service status

## üì± Mobile Experience

The platform is fully responsive and works on all devices:
- **Mobile Phones**: Optimized touch interface with stacked layout
- **Tablets**: Enhanced experience with side-by-side panels
- **Desktop**: Full feature set with multiple panels and advanced tools

## üîÑ Progressive Web App (PWA)

The platform can be installed as a standalone app:
1. Look for the "Install" prompt in your browser
2. Or use your browser's "Add to Home Screen" option
3. Enjoy offline access to previously analyzed requirements
