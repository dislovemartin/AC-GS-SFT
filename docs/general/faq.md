- **Risk Management**: Assessing policy implementation risks and mitigation strategies

### Is this a free service?
The platform offers:
- **Demo Mode**: Free access with full functionality for evaluation
- **Personal Plans**: Starting at $29/month for individual users
- **Team Plans**: Starting at $199/month for small teams
- **Enterprise**: Custom pricing for large organizations with advanced features

### What makes QEC-SFT different from other policy tools?
1. **AI-Enhanced Analysis**: Uses advanced language models for deep semantic understanding
2. **Multi-Format Output**: Generates policies in Rego, TLA+, Python tests, and documentation
3. **Semantic Integrity Certification**: Provides formal certificates of policy coherence
4. **Quantum-Inspired Validation**: Novel approach to fault tolerance in semantic analysis
5. **Security-First Design**: Built-in security analysis and vulnerability assessment

## ü§ñ AI and Technology Questions

### What AI models does the platform use?
- **Primary Model**: NVIDIA Llama-3.1 Nemotron Ultra (253 billion parameters)
- **Capabilities**: Advanced reasoning, code generation, security analysis
- **Backup**: Proprietary simulation algorithms when AI is unavailable
- **Privacy**: All analysis is performed without storing your governance requirements

### How accurate is the AI analysis?
- **Typical Confidence**: 85-95% for well-written requirements
- **Validation**: Multiple stabilizer checks verify semantic consistency
- **Human Review**: Always recommended for critical implementations
- **Continuous Improvement**: Models are regularly updated based on user feedback

### Does the platform store my governance requirements?
- **Demo Mode**: Requirements are not stored permanently
- **Paid Plans**: Optional storage for analysis history and collaboration
- **Privacy Controls**: You control data retention and sharing settings
- **Security**: All data is encrypted in transit and at rest

### What happens when AI service is unavailable?
- **Automatic Fallback**: System switches to simulation mode seamlessly
- **Reduced Capabilities**: Some advanced features may be limited
- **Status Notifications**: Clear indicators show current service status
- **Full Functionality**: Core analysis still available without AI enhancement

## üìù Using the Platform

### How do I write a good governance requirement?
1. **Be Specific**: Include who, what, when, where, and how
2. **Use Active Voice**: "System must validate..." not "Validation should occur..."
3. **Include Constraints**: Specify limits, timeframes, and conditions
4. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Use precise terms rather than vague language

**Example**: 
```
‚ùå "Security should be good"
‚úÖ "User passwords must contain at least 12 characters including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters"
```

### What does "COHERENT" vs "INCOHERENT" mean?
- **COHERENT**: Your requirement passed all semantic integrity checks and can be safely implemented
- **INCOHERENT**: Issues were detected that need attention before implementation
- **Coherence Score**: Percentage indicating overall semantic consistency (aim for >70%)

### How long does analysis take?
- **Simulation Mode**: 1-3 seconds typical
- **AI-Enhanced Mode**: 3-10 seconds typical
- **Complex Requirements**: May take up to 30 seconds
- **Network Dependent**: Times may vary based on connection speed

### Can I analyze multiple requirements at once?
- **Current Limitation**: One requirement per analysis session
- **Workaround**: Process related requirements sequentially
- **Best Practice**: Break complex requirements into smaller components
- **Future Feature**: Batch processing planned for upcoming releases
