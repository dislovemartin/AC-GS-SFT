   ```

2. **Check Rate Limits**
   ```
   - If using heavily, you may hit rate limits
   - Wait a few minutes before making new requests
   - Consider spreading out your analyses over time
   ```

### Analysis Issues

#### Problem: Analysis Fails to Start
**Symptoms:**
- "Execute Pipeline" button remains disabled
- No response when clicking the button
- Error message about invalid input

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Input Requirements**
   ```
   - Ensure your LSU has at least 10 characters
   - Remove any special characters that might cause issues
   - Try a simpler requirement first to test the system
   ```

2. **Example Working LSU:**
   ```
   All user passwords must be at least 8 characters long and contain both letters and numbers.
   ```

3. **Clear and Retry**
   ```
   - Click "Clear Results" if available
   - Delete your current LSU text completely
   - Type a new requirement from scratch
   ```

#### Problem: Analysis Takes Too Long
**Symptoms:**
- Processing indicator shows for more than 30 seconds
- Browser appears frozen or unresponsive
- No progress updates

**Solutions:**
1. **Check System Resources**
   ```
   - Close unnecessary browser tabs
   - Ensure your device has sufficient RAM available
   - Try using a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   ```

2. **Restart the Analysis**
   ```
   - Refresh the page (don't just close the tab)
   - Re-enter your LSU
   - Try with AI-Enhanced Mode disabled first
   ```

3. **Simplify Your LSU**
   ```
   - Break complex requirements into smaller parts
   - Remove unnecessary details for initial testing
   - Test with a simple requirement first
   ```

#### Problem: "INCOHERENT" Results When Expected Success
**Symptoms:**
- Analysis completes but shows INCOHERENT status
- Red warning indicators
- Low coherence scores

**Solutions:**
1. **Review Detailed Diagnostics**
   ```
   - Expand each failed stabilizer check
   - Read the AI-generated remediation suggestions
   - Look for specific issues mentioned in the analysis
   ```

2. **Refine Your LSU**
   ```
   - Make requirements more specific and measurable
   - Remove ambiguous language
   - Add missing context or constraints
   ```

3. **Example Improvements:**
   ```
   ❌ "Security should be good"
   ✅ "All user sessions must timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity"
   
   ❌ "Data needs protection"
   ✅ "Customer data must be encrypted using AES-256 encryption at rest"
   ```

#### Problem: Mobile Interface Issues
**Symptoms:**
